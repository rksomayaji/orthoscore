        <details>A higher score indicates greater disability. The DASH is scored in two components: the disability/symptom questions (30 items, scored 1-5) and the optional high performance sport/music or work section (4 items, scored 1-5). This test does not include the optional sections. The goal of the optional modules is to identify the specific difficulties that professional athletes/performing artists or other groups of workers might experience but which may not affect their activities of daily living and consequently may go “undetected” in the 30-item portion of the DASH.</details>
